*A standard, customizable "About This App" panel for any Mac app*

## About

This library provides a standard "About This App" panel for Mac apps. It requires **zero configuration by default** for typical projects, and it can be easily customized.

AppKit provides a default "About This App" panel via [`NSApp.orderFrontStandardAboutPanel()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsapplication/1428479-orderfrontstandardaboutpanel), but customization is limited.

This component is used in [Red Eye](https://www.hexedbits.com/redeye/) and [Lucifer](https://www.hexedbits.com/lucifer/).
